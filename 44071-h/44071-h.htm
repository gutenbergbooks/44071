      BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,<br />
      <small>BY</small><br />
      <span class="smcap">Hon. JOHN DAVIS</span>,<br />
      <small>LATE JUDGE OF THE U. S. DISTRICT COURT, MASSACHUSETTS DISTRICT.</small>
    </h2>

    <p>
      <span class="smcap">Robert Cushman</span>, the author of the preceding discourse, was
      one of the most distinguished characters among that collection
      of worthies, who quitted England on account of their religious
      difficulties, and settled with Mr. <i>John Robinson</i>, their pastor
      in the city of Leyden, in Holland, in the year 1609. Proposing
      afterwards a removal to America in the year 1617, Mr. Cushman and
      Mr. John Carver, (afterwards the first Governor of New-Plymouth)
      were sent over to England, as their agents, to agree with the
      Virginia Company for a settlement, and to obtain, if possible, a
      grant of liberty of conscience in their intended plantation, from
      King James.
    </p>

    <p>
      From this negotiation though conducted on their part with great
      discretion and ability, they returned unsuccessful to Leyden, in
      May 1618. They met with no difficulty indeed with the Virginia
      Company, who were willing to grant them sufficient territory, with
      as ample privileges as they could bestow: but the pragmatical
      James, the pretended vicegerent of the Deity, refused to grant
      them that liberty in religious matters, which was their principal
      object&mdash;when this persevering people finally determined to
      transport themselves to this country, relying upon James's promise
      that he would <em>connive</em> at, though not expressly <em>tolerate</em> them;
      Mr. Cushman was again dispatched to England in February 1619, with
      Mr. William Bradford, another of the company, to agree with the
      Virginia Company on the terms of their removal and settlement.
    </p>

    <p>
      After much difficulty and delay, they obtained a patent in the
      September following, upon which part of the Church at Leyden, with
      their Elder Mr. Brewster determined to transport themselves as
      procure money, shipping and other necessaries for the voyage, and
      finally embarked with them at South-Hampton, August 5th, 1620.
      But the ship, in which he sailed, proving leaky, and after twice
      putting into port to repair, being finally condemned as unfit to
      perform the voyage, Mr. Cushman with his family, and a number of
      others were obliged, though reluctantly, to relinquish the voyage
      for that time and returned to London. Those in the other ship
      proceeded and made their final settlement at Plymouth in December
      1620, where Mr. Cushman also arrived
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
                                          in the ship Fortune from
      London, on the 10th of November 1621, but took passage in the
      same ship back again, pursuant to the directions of the merchant
      adventurers in London, (who fitted out the ship and by whose
      assistance the first settlers were transported) to give them an
      account of the plantation.
      <a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a title="Go to footnote A" href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a>
                               He sailed from Plymouth December
      13th, 1621, and arriving on the coast of England, the ship, with
      a cargo, valued at 500l. sterling, was taken by the French. Mr.
      Cushman, with the crew, was carried into France; but arrived in
      London in the February following. During his short residence at
      Plymouth, though a mere lay character, he delivered the preceding
      discourse, which was printed in London in 1622, and afterwards
      re-printed in Boston in 1724. And though his name is not prefixed
      to either edition, yet unquestionable tradition renders it certain
      that he was the author, and even transmits to us a knowledge of
      the spot where it was delivered. Mr. Cushman, though he constantly
      corresponded with his friends here, and was very serviceable to
      their interest in London&mdash;never returned to the country again, but
      while preparing for it was removed to a better, in the year 1626.
      The news of his death and Mr. Robinson's arrived at the same time
      at Plymouth, by Captain Standish, and seem to have been equally
      lamented by their bereaved and suffering friends there. He was
      zealously engaged in the prosperity of the plantation, a man of
      activity and enterprise, well versed in business, respectable in
      point of intellectual abilities, well accomplished in scriptural
      knowledge, an unaffected professor, and a steady sincere practiser
      of religion. The design of the following discourse was to keep up
      the noble flow of public spirit, which perhaps began then to abate,
      but which was necessary for their preservation and security.
    </p>

    <p>
      After the death of Mr. Cushman, his family came over to New
      England. His son, Thomas Cushman, succeeded Mr. Brewster, as ruling
      elder of the Church of Plymouth, being ordained to that office
      in 1649. He was a man of good gifts, and frequently assisted in
      carrying on the public worship, preaching, and catechising. For it
      was one professed principle of that Church, in its first formation,
      'to choose none for governing Elders, but such as were able to
      teach.' He continued in this office till he died, in 1691, in the
      eighty-fourth year of his age.
    </p>

    <div class="footnote">
      <p>
        <a name="Footnote_A_1" id="Footnote_A_1"></a>
        It seems to be a mistaken idea that Mr. Cushman
        started in the smaller vessel, which put back on account of its
        proving leaky. This mistake has arisen from the fact that Mr. C.
        was left in England in 1620, and did not come over in the Mayflower
        with the first emigrants. The fact is that Mr. Cushman procured
        'the larger vessel,' the Mayflower, and its pilot at London and
        left in that vessel; but in consequence of the unsoundness of the
        smaller vessel, the Speedwell, it became necessary that part of
        the pilgrims should be left behind, and consequently Mr. Cushman,
        whom Gov. Bradford called 'the right hand with the adventurers,'
        and who 'for divers years had managed all our business with them to
        our great advantage,' was selected as one who would be best able
        to keep together that portion of the flock left behind. Although
        Mr. Cushman did not come over in the Mayflower, yet such was the
        respect for him among those who did come, that his name is placed
        at the head of those who came in that ship, in the allotment of
        land at a time when he was not in New England.

    <h2>
      LETTER FROM JUDGE DAVIS.
    </h2>

    <p class="right">
      <span class="smcap">Boston, Dec. 21, 1846.</span>
    </p>

    <p>
      Dear Sir:
    </p>

    <p>
      Having communicated to me your intention of publishing a new
      edition of Robert Cushman's memorable discourse, delivered in
      Plymouth, 1621, together with the memoir of the author, which I
      prepared for the edition printed by Nathaniel Coverly in Plymouth,
      in 1785; I take the liberty to advise you to follow for your
      purpose that copy of the memoir which was inserted by the Rev. Dr.
      Belknap in the second volume of his American Biography, with the
      addition of some particulars respecting the family, especially of
      elder Thomas Cushman, son of Robert Cushman, and who, like his
      father, was held in high esteem by all his cotemporaries.
    </p>

    <p>
      The original memoir prepared for the Plymouth edition, was
      anonymous. My highly esteemed friend the Rev. Dr. Belknap, in
      giving it a place in his valuable work was pleased to announce the
      name of the writer.
    </p>

    <p>
      The remarks on the discourse originally accompanying the memoir,
      were prompted by views supposed to have been adopted by the
      Plymouth pioneers respecting property and civil polity, in which
      I was afterwards convinced I had made a mistake. I had adopted an
      opinion corresponding with that of Dr. Robertson and other writers,
      that misguided by their religious theories and in imitation of the
      primitive christians, they voluntarily threw all their property
      into a common stock. And that their difficulties and embarrassments
      were greatly enhanced by adopting, and perseveringly adhering to an
      impracticable system. But further inquiry induced the conviction
      that this conjecture was erroneous, and that the severe pressure
      they experienced, was in a great degree produced by the operation
      of their articles of agreement with the adventurers in England,
      which established a community of interest for seven years, and
      prevented the holding in severalty the fruits of their industry and
      enterprise.
    </p>

    <p>
      These views of the subject, and an acknowledgement of my previous
      mistake, were expressed in a discourse delivered at Plymouth, in
      the year 1800, on the anniversary of the landing of the fathers.
      The Rev. Mr. Abbot of Beverly, afterwards, on a like occasion,
      without any knowledge of the contents of that discourse, which was
      not published, was led in his investigation of the subject, into
      a similar conclusion, and fully vindicated the pilgrims from the
      censures
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
               which had been expressed relative to this branch of their
      proceedings. The onerous connection with the merchant adventurers
      remained until 1627, when an amicable and satisfactory settlement
      was made with them by a purchase of all their interest in the
      concern. The sum contracted to be given for this purchase, was 1800
      pounds sterling, payable by instalments of 200 pounds annually.
    </p>

    <p>
      Thus says Governor Bradford in one of his letters:
    </p>

    <div class="blockquot">
      "All now is become our own, as we say in the proverb, when
      our debts are paid. And doubtless this was a great mercy of
      God unto us, and a great means of peace and better subsistence,
      and wholly dashed all the plots and devices of our enemies, both
      there and here, who daily expected our ruin, dispersion and utter
      subversion by the same; but their hopes were thus far prevented
      though with great care and labor, we were left to struggle with the
      payment of the money."
    </div>

    <p>
      Under these impressions I think it will be well for you to omit
      the insertion of the remarks above mentioned on Mr. Cushman's
      discourse. That discourse is a precious relic of ancient times, the
      sound sense, good advice, and pious spirit, which it manifests,
      will, it may be hoped, now, and in all future time, meet with
      approval and beneficial acceptance in our community.
    </p>

    <p>
      The information contained in the note of your correspondent
      respecting Mr. Cushman's embarcation, and the assignment of land
      made to him in the colony, is believed to be correct.

    </h2>

    <p>
      <span class="smcap">New-England</span>, so called, not only (to avoid novelties)
      because Captain <i>Smith</i> hath so entitled it in his Description,
      but because of the resemblance that is in it, of <i>England</i> the
      native soil of Englishmen; it being much what the same for heat
      and cold in Summer and Winter, it being champaign ground, but no
      high mountains, somewhat like the soil in <i>Kent</i> and <i>Essex</i>; full
      of dales, and meadow ground, full of rivers and sweet springs, as
      <i>England</i> is. But principally, so far as we can yet find, it is an
      island, and near about the quantity of <i>England</i>, being cut out
      from the main land in <i>America</i>, as <i>England</i> is from the main
      of <i>Europe</i>, by a great arm of the sea, which entereth in forty
      degrees, and runneth up North West and by West, and goeth out
      either into the South-Sea, or else into the Bay of <i>Canada</i>. The
      certainty whereof, and secrets of which, we have not yet so found
      as that as eye-witnesses we can make narration thereof, but if God
      give time and means, we shall, ere long, discover both the extent
      of that river, together with the secrets thereof; and so try what
      territories, habitations, or commodities, may be found, either in
      it, or about it.
    </p>

    <p>
      It pertaineth not to my purpose to speak any thing either in
      praise, or dispraise of the country; so it is by God's Providence,
      that a few of us are there planted to our content, and have with
      great charge and difficulty attained quiet and competent dwellings
      there. And thus much I will say for the satisfaction of such as
      have any thought of going hither to inhabit? That for men which
      have a large heart, and look after great riches, ease, pleasures,
      dainties, and jollity in this world (except they will live by other
      men's sweat, or have great riches) I would not advise them to come
      there, for as yet the country will afford no such matters: But if
      there be any who are content to lay out their estates, spend their
      time, labors, and endeavors, for the benefit of them that shall
      come after, and in desire to further the gospel among those poor
      heathens, quietly contenting themselves with such hardship and
      difficulties, as by God's Providence shall fall upon them, being
      yet young, and in their strength, such men I would advise and
      encourage to go, for their ends cannot fail them.
    </p>

    <p>
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
      And if it should please God to punish his people in the Christian
      countries of <i>Europe</i>, (for their coldness, carnality, wanton
      abuse of the Gospel, contention, &amp;c.) either by Turkish slavery,
      or by popish tyranny which God forbid, yet if the time be come,
      or shall come (as who knoweth) when Satan shall be let loose to
      cast out his floods against them, (<cite>Rev. 12. 14. 15.</cite>) here is a
      way opened for such as have wings to fly into this wilderness; and
      as by the dispersion of the Jewish church through persecution,
      the Lord brought in the fulness of the Gentiles, (<cite>Act. 11. 20,
      21.</cite>) so who knoweth, whether now by tyranny and affliction, he
      suffereth to come upon them, he will not by little and little chase
      them even amongst the heathens, that so a light may rise up in the
      dark, (<cite>Luke 2. 32.</cite>) and the kingdom of Heaven be taken from them
      which now have it, and given to a people that shall bring forth the
      fruit of it. (<cite>Mat. 21. 43.</cite>) This I leave to the judgment of the
      godly wise, being neither prophet nor son of a prophet, (<cite>Amos 7.
      14.</cite>) but considering God's dealing of old, (<cite>2 Kings 17, 23.</cite>) and
      seeing the name of Christian to be very great, but the true nature
      thereof almost quite lost in all degrees and sects, I cannot think
      but that there is some judgment not far off, and that God will
      shortly, even of stones, raise up children unto <i>Abraham</i>. (<cite>Mat.
      3. 5.</cite>)
    </p>

    <p>
      And who so rightly considereth what manner of entrance, abiding,
      and proceedings, we have had among these poor heathens since we
      came hither, will easily think, that God has some great work to do
      towards them.
    </p>

    <p>
      They were wont to be the most cruel and treacherous people in all
      these parts, even like lions, but to us they have been like lambs,
      so kind, so submissive, and trusty, as a man may truly say, many
      christians are not so kind, nor sincere.
    </p>

    <p>
      They were very much wasted of late, by reason of a great mortality
      that fell amongst them three years since, which together with their
      own civil dissentions and bloody wars, hath so wasted them, as I
      think the twentieth person is scarce left alive, and those that
      are left, have their courage much abated, and their countenance is
      dejected, and they seem as a people affrighted. And though when
      we came first into the Country, we were few, and many of us were
      sick, and many died by reason of the cold and wet, it being the
      depth of winter, and we having no houses, nor shelter, yet when
      there was not six able persons among us, and that they came daily
      to us by hundreds, with their <i>sachems</i> or <i>kings</i>, and might in
      one hour have made a dispatch of us, yet such a fear was upon them,
      as that they never offered us the least injury in word or deed.
      And by reason of one <i>Tisquanto</i>, that lives amongst us, that can
      speak English, we have daily commerce with their kings, and can
      know what is done or intended towards us among the savages; also
      we can acquaint them with our courses and purposes, both human
      and religious. And the greatest

                                      commander of the country, called
      <i>Massasoit</i>, cometh often to visit us, tho' he lives 50 miles from
      us, often sends us presents, he having with many other of their
      governors, promised, yea, subscribed obedience to our sovereign
      Lord King James, and for his cause to spend both strength and life.
      And we for our parts, through God's grace, have with that equity,
      justice, and compassion, carried ourselves towards them, as that
      they have received much favor, help, and aid from us, but never the
      least injury or wrong by us.
      <a name="FNanchor_A_2" id="FNanchor_A_2"></a><a title="Go to footnote A" href="#Footnote_A_2" class="fnanchor">[A]</a>
                                   We found the place where we live
      empty, the people being all dead and gone away, and none living
      near by 8 or 10 miles; and though in the time of some hardship we
      found (travelling abroad) near 8 bushels of corn hid up in a cave,
      and knew no owners of it, yet afterwards hearing of the owners of
      it, we gave them (in their estimation) double the value of it. Our
      care hath been to maintain peace amongst them, and have always set
      ourselves against such of them as used any rebellion, or treachery
      against their governors, and not only threatened such, but in some
      sort paid them their due deserts; and when any of them are in want,
      as often they are in the winter, when their corn is done, we supply
      them to our power, and have them in our houses eating and drinking,
      and warming themselves, which thing (though it be something a
      trouble to us) yet because they should see and take knowledge of
      our labors, order and diligence, both for this life and a better,
      we are content to bear it, and we find in many of them, especially,
      of the younger sort, such a tractable disposition, both to religion
      and humanity, as that if we had means to apparel them, and wholly
      to retain them with us (as their desire is) they would doubtless
      in time prove serviceable to God and man, and if ever God send us
      means we will bring up hundreds of their children, both to labor
      and learning.
    </p>

    <p>
      But leaving to speak of them till a further occasion be offered; if
      any shall marvel at the publishing of this treatise in <i>England</i>,
      seeing there is no want of good books, but rather want of men to
      use good books, let them know, that the especial end is, that we
      may keep those motives in memory for ourselves, and those that
      shall come after, to be a remedy against self love the bane of
      all societies. And that we also might testify to our Christian
      countrymen, who judge diversly of us, that though we be in a
      heathen country, yet the grace of Christ is not quenched in us, but
      we still hold and teach the same points of faith, mortification,
      and sanctification, which we have heard and learned, in a most
      ample and large manner in our own country. If any shall think it
      too rude and unlearned for this curious age, let them know, that to
      paint out the Gospel in plain and flat English, amongst a company
      of plain Englishmen (as we are) is the best and most profitablest
      teaching; and we will study plainness, not curiosity, neither in
      things human, nor heavenly. If any error or unsoundness be in
      it, (as who knoweth) impute it to that frail man which endited
      it, which professeth to know nothing
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
                                           as he ought to know it. I
      have not set down my name, partly because I seek no name, and
      principally, because I would have nothing esteemed by names, for I
      see a number of evils to arise through names, when the persons are
      either famous, or infamous, and God and man is often injured; if
      any good or profit arise to thee in the receiving of it, give God
      the praise and esteem me as a son of <i>Adam</i>, subject to all such
      frailties as other men are.
    </p>

    <p>
      And you my loving friends the adventurers to this plantation; as
      your care has been, first to settle religion here, before either
      profit or popularity, so I pray you, go on, to do it much more, and
      be careful to send godly men, though they want some of that worldly
      policy which this world hath in her own generation, and so though
      you lose, the Lord shall gain. I rejoice greatly in your free and
      ready minds to your powers, yea, and beyond your powers to further
      this work, that you thus honor God with your riches, and I trust
      you shall be repayed again double and treble in this world, yea,
      and the memory of this action shall never die, but above all adding
      unto this (as I trust you do) like freeness in all other God's
      services both at home and abroad, you shall find reward with God,
      ten thousand-fold surpassing all that you can do or think; be not
      therefore discouraged, for no labor is lost, nor money spent which
      is bestowed for God, your ends were good, your success is good, and
      your profit is coming, even in this life, and in the life to come
      much more: and what shall I say now, a word to men of understanding
      sufficeth, pardon I pray you my boldness, read over the ensuing
      treatise, and judge wisely of the poor weakling, and the Lord, the
      God of land and sea, stretch out his arm of protection over you and
      us, and over all our lawful and good enterprizes, either this, or
      any other way.

    <h3>
      1 CORINTHIANS, 10. 24.<br />
      LET NO MAN SEEK HIS OWN: BUT EVERY MAN ANOTHER'S WEALTH.
    </h3>

    <p>
      The occasion of these words of the Apostle <i>Paul</i>, was because of
      the abuses which were in the Church of <i>Corinth</i>. Which abuses
      arose chiefly through swelling pride, self-love and conceitedness,
      for although this church was planted by <i>Paul</i> and watered by
      <i>Apollos</i>, and much increased by the Lord; yet the sower of
      tares was not wanting to stir up evil workers and fleshly minded
      hypocrites, under a shew of godliness, and with angel-like holiness
      in appearance, to creep in amongst them to disturb their peace, try
      their soundness, and prove their constancy. And this the Apostle
      complains of very often: as first, in their carnal divisions, chap.
      1. then in their extolling their eloquent teachers, and despising
      <i>Paul</i>, chap. 4. Then in their offensive going to Law, before the
      heathen judges, chap. 6. Then in eating things offered to idols, to
      the destroying of the tender consciences of their brethren, chap.
      8. Then in their insatiable love feasts, in the time and place
      of their church meetings, the rich which could together feed to
      fulness, despising and contemning the poor, that had not to lay it
      on as they had, chap. 11. Finally in both the epistles, he very
      often nippeth them for their pride, and self-love, straitness and
      censoriousness, so that in the last chapter he willeth them again
      and again to prove, try and examine themselves, to see whether
      Christ were in them or not, for howsoever many of them seemed, as
      thousands do at this day to soar aloft, and go with full sail to
      Heaven: yet as men that row in
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
                                     boats, set their faces one way,
      when yet their whole body goeth apace another way: so there are
      many which set such a face upon religion, and have their mouth full
      of great swelling words: as if they would even blow open the doors
      of heaven, despising all humble minded and broken-hearted people,
      as weak, simple, sottish, &amp;c. when yet notwithstanding, these
      blusterers, which seem to go so fast, and leave all others behind
      them, if like these glosing <i>Corinthians</i>, they carry affectedly
      their own glory with them, and seem thus to stand for the glory of
      God. What do they else but join flesh to spirit, serving not God
      for nought, but for wages, and so serving their bellies, whose end
      will be damnation, except a speedy and sound remedy be thought of,
      which remedy is even that which our Saviour teacheth the rich young
      gallant, and which <i>Paul</i> here prescribeth, in willing them not to
      seek their own, but every man another's wealth, which physic is as
      terrible to carnal professors, as abstinence from drink is to a man
      that hath the dropsy; and it is a sure note, that a man is sick of
      this disease of self-love, if this be grievous to him, as appeareth
      in the man whom Christ bid sell that he had, and he went away very
      sorrowful, yet surely this vein must be pricked, and this humor let
      out, else it will spoil all, it will infect both soul and body,
      yea, and the contagion of it is such (as we shall see anon) as will
      even hazard the welfare of that society where self seekers and self
      lovers are.
    </p>

    <p>
      As God then did direct this Apostle to lay down this brief
      direction as a remedy for that evil in <i>Corinth</i>, so you may think
      it is by God's special providence, that I am now to speak unto you
      from this text: and say in your hearts, surely something is amiss
      this way: let us know it and amend it.
    </p>

    <p>
      The parts of this text are two. 1. A <i>Dehortation</i>. 2. An
      <i>Exhortation</i>. The Dehortation, <em>Let no man seek his own</em>. The
      Exhortation, <em>But every man another's wealth</em>.
    </p>

    <p>
      In handling of which, I will first, open the words. Secondly,
      gather the doctrine. Thirdly illustrate the doctrine by scriptures,
      experience and reasons. Fourthly apply the same, to every one his
      portion.
    </p>

    <p>
      The proper drift of the Apostle here is not to tax the
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
      <i>Corinthians</i>, for seeking their own evil ends in evil actions,
      but for aiming at themselves, and their own benefits in actions
      lawful, and that appeareth in the former verse, where he saith,
      <em>All things are lawful, &amp;c.</em> viz. all such things as now we speak
      of, to eat any of God's creatures, offered to idols or not, to
      feast and be merry together, to shew love and kindness to this or
      that person, &amp;c. but when by such means we seek ourselves, and have
      not a charitable loving and reverent regard of others, then they
      are unexpedient, unprofitable, yea unlawful, and must be forborne,
      and he that hath not learned to deny himself even the very use
      of lawful things, when it tendeth to the contempt, reproach,
      grief, offence and shame of his other brethren and associates,
      hath learned nothing aright, but is, apparently, a man that seeks
      himself, and against whom the Apostle here dealeth most properly.
    </p>

    <p>
      The manner of the speech, may seem as counsel left at liberty: as
      Mat. 27. 49. And in our ordinary speech, we think they be but weak
      charges, which are thus delivered, let a man do this, or let him
      do that. But we must learn the apostle's modesty, and know that
      whatsoever the terms seem to imply, yet even this and other the
      like in this epistle, are most absolute charges: as, <em>Let a man
      esteem of us, as the ministers of Christ</em>, <cite>chap. 41</cite>. That is, a
      man ought so to esteem of us. <em>Let a man examine himself</em>, <cite>1 Cor.
      11. 28</cite>. That is, as if he said, a man must examine himself. <em>Let
      your women keep silence in the churches</em>, <cite>1 Cor. 14, 34</cite>. that is,
      they ought so to do.
    </p>

    <p>
      The meaning then summarily is, as if he said, the bane of all these
      mischiefs which arise among you is, that men are too cleaving to
      themselves and their own matters, and disregard and contemn all
      others: and therefore I charge you, let this self seeking be left
      off, and turn the stream another way, namely, seek the good of your
      brethren, please them, honor them, reverence them, for otherwise it
      will never go well amongst you.
    </p>

    <p>
      <i>Obj.</i> But doth not the Apostle elsewhere say? <em>That he, which
      careth not for his own, is worse than an infidel.</em> <cite>1 Tim. 5. 8.</cite>
    </p>

    <p>
      <i>Ans.</i> True, but by (own) there, he meaneth properly, a man's
      kindred, and here by (own) he meaneth properly a man's self.
    </p>

    <p>
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
      Secondly, he there especially taxeth such as were negligent in
      their labors and callings, and so made themselves unable to give
      relief and entertainment to such poor widows and orphans as were of
      their own flesh and blood.
    </p>

    <p>
      Thirdly, be it so, that some man should even neglect his own self,
      his own wife, children, friends, &amp;c. And give that he had to
      strangers, that were but some rare vice, in some one unnatural man,
      and if this vice slay a thousand, self-love slayeth ten thousands.
    </p>

    <p>
      And this the wisdom of God did well foresee, and hath set no
      caveats in the scriptures either to tax men, or forewarn them
      from loving others, neither saith God any where, let no man seek
      out the good of another, but let no man seek his own, and every
      where in the scriptures he hath set watch words against self good,
      self-profit, self-seeking, &amp;c. And thus the sense being cleared, I
      come to the doctrine.
    </p>

    <p>
      Doct. 1. <em>All men are too apt and ready to seek themselves too
      much, and to prefer their own matters and causes beyond the due and
      lawful measure, even to excess and offence against God, yea danger
      of their own souls.</em>
    </p>

    <p>
      And this is true not only in wicked men which are given over of
      God to vile lusts, as <i>Absalom</i> in getting favor in his father's
      court: <i>Jereboam</i>, in settling his kingdom fast in <i>Samaria</i>,
      <i>Ahab</i> in vehement seeking <i>Naboth's</i> vineyard, but men, otherwise
      godly, have through frailty been foiled herein, and many thousands
      which have a shew of godliness, are lovers of themselves: <i>David</i>
      was about to seek himself when he was going to kill <i>Naball</i>:
      <i>Asa</i> in putting <i>Hanani</i> in prison: <i>Josiah</i> when he would go to
      war with <i>Necho</i>, against the counsel of God, and reason; <i>Peter</i>
      when he dissembled about the ceremonies of the law, yea and <i>Paul</i>
      complains of all his followers (<i>Timothy</i> excepted) that they
      sought their own too inordinately.
    </p>

    <hr />

    <p>
      And why else are these caveats in the scriptures, but to warn the
      godly that they be not tainted herewith? as, <em>Look not every man
      on his own things, but on the things of another: Love seeketh not
      her own things. Be not desirous of vain glory, &amp;c.</em> Philip. 2. 4. 1
      Cor. 13. 6. Gal. 5. 26.
    </p>

    <p>
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
      Yea and doth not experience teach, that even amongst professors
      of religion, almost all the love and favor that is shewed unto
      others is with a secret aim at themselves, they will take pains
      to do a man good, provided that he will take twice so much for
      them, they will give a penny so as it may advantage them a pound,
      labor hard so as all the profit may come to themselves, else
      they are heartless and feeble. The vain and corrupt heart of man
      cannot better be resembled then by a belly-god, host, or innkeeper
      which welcometh his guests with smilings, and salutations, and a
      thousand welcomes, and rejoiceth greatly to have their company to
      dice, cards, eat, drink, and be merry, but should not the box be
      paid, the pot be filling, and the money telling, all this while,
      the epicure's joy would soon be turned into sorrow, and his smiles
      turned into frowns, and the door set open, and their absence
      craved: even so men blow the bellows hard, when they have an iron
      of their own a heating, work hard whilst their own house is in
      building, dig hard whilst their own garden is in planting, but
      is it so as the profit must go wholly or partly to others; their
      hands wax feeble, their hearts wax faint, they grow churlish, and
      give cross answers, like <i>Naball</i>, they are sour, discontent, and
      nothing will please them. And where is that man to be found, that
      will disperse abroad, and cast his bread upon the waters, that
      will lend, looking for nothing again, that will do all duties to
      other freely and cheerfully in conscience to God, and love unto
      men, without his close and secret ends or aiming at himself; such
      a man, out of doubt, is a black swan, a white crow almost, and yet
      such shall stand before God with boldness at the last day, when
      others which have sought themselves, though for love of themselves
      they have sought heaven, yea, and through self-love persuaded
      themselves they should find it, yet wanting love unto others, they
      will be found as sounding brass, and as a tinkling cimbal, and
      whilst they have neglected others, and not cared how others live,
      so as themselves may fare well, they will be found amongst them,
      that the Lord will say unto, <em>I know you not, depart ye cursed into
      everlasting fire</em>, Mat. 25. 41. 42.
    </p>

    <p>
      But that I may not walk in generalities, the particular
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
                                                                 ways by
      which men seek their own are these: First, such as are covetous,
      seek their own by seeking riches, wealth, money, as <i>Felix</i>
      pretending love unto <i>Paul</i>, sent for him often, but it was in hope
      of money. Many there are who say, <em>who will shew us any good</em>,
      Psal. 4. 7. And pretend religion, as some of the Jews did the
      keeping of the Sabbath, which yet cried out, when will the Sabbath
      be done, that we may sell corn, and get gain; if a man can tell how
      to get gold out of a flint, and silver out of the adamant, no pains
      shall be spared, no time shall be neglected, for gold is their
      hope, and the wedge of gold is their confidence, their hearts are
      set upon the pelf of this world, and for love of it, all things are
      let slip, even all duties to God or men, they care not how basely
      they serve, how wretchedly they neglect all others, so as they may
      get wealth: pinch who will, and wring who will; all times are alike
      with them, and they run for the bribe and <i>Gehazie</i>; and this is
      the first way that men seek their own.
    </p>

    <p>
      Now the contrary is seen in <i>Nehemiah</i>, who when the people were
      hard put to it, and the land raw, he took not the duties which
      were due to him being a magistrate, he bought no land, nor grew
      rich, for it was no time: but he maintained at his table many of
      his brethren the Jews, and so spent even his own proper goods.
      And <i>Paul</i> sought no man's gold nor silver, but though he had
      authority, yet he took not bread of the churches, but labored with
      his hands: and why? It was no time to take, some churches were poor
      and stood in want, as <i>Thessalonica</i>, others were in danger to be
      preyed upon by covetous belly-gods, as <i>Corinth</i>: and therefore he
      saw it no fit time now to take any thing of them.
    </p>

    <p>
      And indeed here is the difference between a covetous worldling,
      and an honest thrifty Christian, it is lawful sometimes for men to
      gather wealth, and grow rich, even as there was a time for <i>Joseph</i>
      to store up corn, but a godly and sincere Christian will see when
      this time is, and will not hoard up when he seeth others of his
      brethren and associates to want, but then is a time, if he have any
      thing to fetch it out and disperse it, but the covetous gathers
      goods, he like <i>Achan</i> covets all that he seeth; and neglects no
      time, but gathers still and holds all fast, and
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
                                                      if it were to save
      the life of his brother, his bags must not be diminished, nor his
      chests lighted, nor his field set to sale, gather as much as he
      can, but it's death to diminish the least part of it.
    </p>

    <p>
      2. The second way by which men seek their own, is when they seek
      ease, or pleasure, as the <i>Scribes</i> and <i>Pharisees</i>, who would
      not touch the burden with one of their fingers; for there is a
      generation, which think to have more in this world then <i>Adam's</i>
      felicity in innocency, being born (as they think) to take their
      pleasures, and their ease, let the roof of the house drop through,
      they stir not; let the field be overgrown with weeds, they care
      not, they must not foul their hand, nor wet their foot, it's enough
      for them to say, Go you, not let us go, though never so much need;
      such idle drones, are intollerable in a settled commonwealth, much
      more in a commonwealth which is but as it were in the bud; of what
      earth I pray thee art thou made, of any better than the other of
      the sons of <i>Adam</i>? And canst thou see other of thy brethren toil
      their hearts out, and thou sit idle at home, or takest thy pleasure
      abroad? Remember the example of <i>Uriah</i>, who would not take his
      ease nor his pleasure, though the King required him, and why?
      Because his brethren, his associates, better men than himself (as
      he esteemed them) were under hard labors and conditions, lay in the
      field in tents, caves, &amp;c.
    </p>

    <p>
      3. The third way is when men seek their own bellies, as some did
      in the Apostles' times, which went about with new doctrines and
      devices, knowing that the people had itching ears, and would
      easily entertain and willingly feed such novelists, which brought
      in dissensions, schisms, and contentions, and such were rocks, or
      pillars in their love-feasts, as <i>Jude</i> speaketh, <cite>ver. 12.</cite> They
      were shadows in God's service, but when feasting came, then they
      were substances, then they were in their element. And certainly
      there are some men which shape even their religion, human state,
      and all, even as the belly cheer is best, and that they must have,
      else all heart and life is gone; let all conscience, care of others
      go, let <i>Lazarus</i> starve at the gate, let <i>Joseph's</i> affliction
      be increased, they must have their dishes, their dainties, or no
      content. The contrary was
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
                                seen in <i>Nehemiah</i>, who would not take
      his large portion allotted to the governor, because he knew it went
      short with others of his brethren; and <i>Uriah</i> would not receive
      the King's present, and go banquet with his wife, because he knew
      the whole host his brethren were fain to snap short in the fields.
    </p>

    <p>
      And the difference between a temperate good man, and a belly-god
      is this: A good man will not eat his morsels alone, especially, if
      he have better than others, but if by God's providence, he have
      gotten some meat which is better than ordinary, and better than
      his other brethren, he can have no rest in himself, except he make
      others partake with him. But a belly-god will slop all in his own
      throat, yea, though his neighbor come in and behold him eat, yet
      his griple-gut shameth not to swallow all. And this may be done
      sometimes, as well in mean fare as in greater dainties, for all
      countries afford not alike.
    </p>

    <p>
      4. The fourth way by which men seek their own, is by seeking
      outward honor, fame and respect with men; as King <i>Saul</i> when he
      had lost all respect and favor with God, then thought to give
      content to his heart by being honored before the Elders of the
      people; and it is wonderful to see how some men are <em>desirous of
      vain glory</em>, <i>Gal.</i> 5. 26. And how earnestly they seek praise,
      favor, and respect with men, and can have no quiet longer than
      their worldly favor lasteth, and that they will have what dishonor
      soever come to God, or disgrace unto men, yea, they will disgrace,
      reproach, and disdain others, to gain honor and advancement to
      themselves, yea, they will make bold with the Scriptures and Word
      of God, to wrest and wring, and slight it over for their credit's
      sake. And let a man mark some men's talk, stories, discourses,
      &amp;c. and he shall see their whole drift is to extol and set out
      themselves, and get praise and commendation of men.
    </p>

    <p>
      Now the contrary was seen in <i>Paul</i>, he saith, <em>He needed no
      letters of commendations</em>, 2 Cor. 3. 2. And again, <em>He is
      not affected with men's praise</em>, 1 Cor. 10. 12. And here is
      indeed the difference between an humble-minded Christian, and a
      proud self-lover; an humble man often hath praise, as <i>David</i>,
      <i>Hezekiah</i>, and <i>Josiah</i>, but he seeks it not, he desires it not,
      he is content to go without it, he loves
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
                                               not the praise of men,
      for he knows it but froth and vanity: but a proud self-lover, he
      seeks it still, get it or not get it, and if he get it he is fully
      satisfied, if he get it not he hangs his head like a bull-rush, and
      hath no comfort.
    </p>

    <p>
      5. The fifth way by which men seek their own, is <em>by seeking to
      have their wills</em>; as the wrong doers in <i>Corinth</i>, who thought
      it not enough to do wrong and harm to their brethren, but to
      have their wills enough of them, drew them before the Heathen
      magistrates.
    </p>

    <p>
      And truly some men are so prince-like, or rather Papal, that their
      very will and word is become a law, and if they have said it, it
      must be so, else there is no rest or quietness to be had, let never
      so many reasons be brought to the contrary, it is but fighting with
      the wind. They are like the obstinate Jews, who when against God's
      law, and reason, they asked a King, though <i>Samuel</i> shewed them
      that it would turn in the end to their own smart, yet still held
      the conclusion, and said, nay, <em>But we will have a King</em>, 1 Sam.
      8. 19. Thus men are caught by their own words, and insnared by the
      straitness of their own hearts, and it is death to them not to have
      their wills, and howsoever sometimes (like <i>Jezebel</i>) they are cut
      short of their purposes, yet self-willed men will strut and swell
      like <i>Absalom</i>, saying neither <em>good nor bad</em>, 2 Sam. 13. 22. but
      hope for the day, and threaten like prophane <i>Esau</i>, Gen. 27. 41.
      Now the contrary is seen in <i>David</i>, though a prince, a captain, a
      warrior, who having said, yea sworn, that he would kill <i>Nabal</i>,
      and all his family that day, yet upon reasonable counsel given, and
      that by a weak woman, he changed his mind, altered his purpose,
      and returned, without striking one stroke, an example rare, and
      worthy imitation; and when men are sick of will, let them think of
      <i>David</i>, it was his grace and honor to go back from his word and
      practice, when reason came. So was it <i>Herod's</i> disgrace and shame
      to hold his word and will against reason and conscience, <cite>Math.
      14. 8, 9.</cite>
    </p>

    <p>
      <i>Quest.</i> But some men happily will say unto me, It is true, that
      men seek their own by all these ways, <em>But what should be the
      reason and cause of this? that men seek so earnestly themselves, in
      seeking riches, honor, ease, belly-cheer, will, &amp;c. something there
      is that carrieth them</em>.
    </p>

    <p>
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
      <i>Ans.</i> True, and the reasons and causes are specially these three:
    </p>

    <p>
      First, pride and high conceitedness, when men overvalue themselves:
      and this made <i>Absalom</i> to seek his father's kingdom, because he
      thought himself worthy of it. <cite>2 Sam. 15. 4.</cite> This made <i>Haman</i> so
      sore vexed, because <i>Mordecai</i> bowed not to him, because he highly
      valued himself, <cite>Esther, 3. 5.</cite>
    </p>

    <p>
      And surely that which a man valueth much, he giveth much respect
      to, and so it is a sure sign that a man loves himself most when
      he giveth most to himself; and some intolerable proud persons
      even think all the world is for them, and all their purposes and
      endeavors shew what a large conceit they have of themselves.
    </p>

    <p>
      Secondly, want of due consideration and valuation of other
      men's endowments, abilities and deserts; when men pass those
      things by, though they have both seen, heard, and felt them; as
      <i>Pharaoh's</i> butler forgot <i>Joseph's</i> eminency when he was restored
      to his place, <cite>Gen. 40. 23.</cite> So men used to write their own good
      actions in brass, but other men's in ashes, never remembering nor
      considering the pains, labor, good properties, &amp;c. which others
      have, and so they have no love to them, but only to themselves; as
      if God had made all other men unreasonable beasts, and them only
      reasonable men.
    </p>

    <p>
      Thirdly, want of heavenly conversation, and spiritual eye to
      behold the glory, greatness, and majesty, and goodness of God;
      as the Queen of <i>Sheba</i>, thought highly of her own glory, wisdom
      and happiness, till she saw <i>Solomon's</i> wisdom and glory, and
      then she cried out, not of the happiness of her own servants, but
      of his servants that stood before him, <cite>1 Kings 10. 7, 8.</cite> And
      verily, if men were conversant courtiers in Heaven, they would
      cry out with <i>Paul</i>, Rom. 11. 33. <em>Oh the depth of the riches,
      wisdom, and knowledge of God, &amp;c.</em> and would be ashamed of their
      own sinfulness, nakedness and misery; for, as countrymen which
      never saw the state of cities, nor the glory of courts, admire even
      their own country Orders: And as the savages here which are clad in
      skins, and creep in woods and holes, think their own brutish and
      inhuman life the best, which if they saw and did rightly apprehend
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
      the benefit of comely humanity, the sweetness of religion and
      the service of God, they would even shamefully hide themselves
      from the eye of all noble Christians. Even so, if men in serious
      contemplation, by the eye of faith, would behold the glory of God,
      and what great riches, beauty, fulness, perfection, power, dignity
      and greatness is in God, they would leave admiring of themselves,
      and seeking of themselves, and would say with <em>David, What am I?
      And what is my father's house? that thou shouldest thus bless me?</em>
      2 Sam. 7. 18. Yea <em>What is man? or the son of man that thou so
      regardest him?</em> Psal. 8. 3.
    </p>

    <p>
      But it is time to come to apply these things more particularly to
      ourselves, and see what Use is to be made of them:
    </p>

    <p>
      <i>Use 1.</i> Is it so, that God seeth a proneness in all the sons of
      <i>Adam</i>, to seek themselves too much, and hath given them warnings
      and watch-words thereof, as we have heard, and doth experience
      confirm it? Then hence are reproved a number of men, who think
      they can never shew love enough to themselves, nor seek their own
      enough, but think all cost, charges, cherishing, praise, honor,
      &amp;c. too little for them, and no man needeth to say to them, as
      <i>Peter</i> did to Christ, <em>favor thy self</em>; but if they do a little
      for another man, they account it a great matter, though it be but
      a morsel of bread, or a single penny; but no varieties of dainties
      is too good for them, no silk, purple, cloth, or stuff is too
      good to clothe them, the poor man's idleness and ill husbandry is
      oft thrown in his dish, but their own carnal delights and fleshy
      wantonness is never thought upon: and why? Because they think even
      God and man owes all to them, but they owe nothing to none. Why,
      thou foolish and besotted man, hath not the Holy Ghost read it in
      the very face of every son of <i>Adam</i>, that he is too apt to seek
      his own, and art thou wiser than God, to think thou never seekest
      thine own enough? or dreamest thou that thou art made of other, and
      better mettle than other men are? Surely, I know no way to escape,
      having of corruption to thy father, and the worm to thy sister and
      brother. And if God had any where in all the Scriptures said, love
      thyself, make much of thyself, provide for one, &amp;c. there were some
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
       reason for thee to take up the niggard's proverbs, <em>Every
      man for himself, and God for us all; Charity beginneth at home,
      &amp;c.</em> But God never taught thee these things; No, they are Satan's
      positions. Doth God ever commend a man for carnal love of himself?
      Nay he brands it, and disgraceth it, as <em>self love, taking thought
      for the flesh; loving of pleasure, &amp;c.</em> Rom. 13. 14, 2 Tim. 34.
    </p>

    <p>
      <i>Obj.</i> <em>It is a point of good natural policy, for a man to care and
      provide for himself.</em>
    </p>

    <p>
      <i>Ans.</i> Then the most fools have most natural policy, for you
      see not the greatest drones and novices, either in church, or
      commonwealth, to be the greatest scratchers and scrapers, and
      gatherers of riches? Are they not also for the most part, best fed
      and clad? And live they not most easily? What shall I say? Even
      hogs, dogs, and brute beasts know their own ease, and can seek
      that which is good for themselves; and what doth this shifting,
      progging, and fat feeding which some use, more resemble any thing
      than the fashion of hogs? And so let it be what natural policy it
      will.
    </p>

    <p>
      <i>Use 2.</i> If God see this disease of self-love so dangerous in
      us, then it standeth us all in hand to suspect ourselves, and so
      to seek out the root of this disease, that it may be cured. If a
      learned physician, shall see by our countenance and eye, that we
      have some dangerous disease growing on us, our hearts will smite
      us, and we will bethink ourselves where the most grief lieth, and
      how it should come, whether with cold, heat, surfeit, over-flowing
      of blood, or through grief, melancholy, or any such way, and every
      man will bestir himself to get rid of it, and will prevent always
      that which feeds the disease, and cherish all courses that would
      destroy it.
    </p>

    <p>
      Now, how much more ought we to bestir ourselves, for this matter
      of self love, since God himself hath cast all our waters, and felt
      all our pulses, and pronounceth us all dangerously sick of this
      disease? Believe it, God cannot lie, nor be deceived; He that made
      the heart, doth not he know it? Let every man's heart smite him,
      and let him fall to the examination of himself and see first,
      whether he love not riches and worldly wealth too much, whether his
      heart be not too jocund at the coming of it in, and too
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
                                                              heavy at
      the going of it out, for if you find it so there is great danger,
      if thou canst not buy as if thou possessed not, and use this world
      as though thou used it not, (<cite>1 Cor. 7. 30, 31.</cite>) thou art sick,
      and had need to look to it. So, if thou lovest thine ease and
      pleasure, see whether thou can be content to receive at God's hands
      evil as well as good, (<cite>Job 2. 10.</cite>) whether thou have learned as
      well to abound as to want, (<cite>Phil. 4. 10.</cite>) as well to endure hard
      labor, as to live at ease; and art as willing to go to the house of
      mourning as to the house of mirth, (<cite>Eccl. 7. 6.</cite>) for, else, out
      of doubt, thou lovest thy carnal pleasure and ease too much.
    </p>

    <p>
      Again, see whether thy heart cannot be as merry, and thy mind as
      joyful, and thy countenance as cheerful, with coarse fare, with
      pulse, with bread and water (if God offer thee no better, nor the
      times afford other) as if thou had the greatest dainties: (<cite>Dan.
      1. 15.</cite>) So also whether thou can be content as well with scorns
      of men, when thou hast done well, as with their praises, so if
      thou can with comfort and good conscience say, I pass little for
      man's judgment; whether thou can do thy duty that God requireth,
      and despise the shame, referring thyself unto God, for if thou be
      disheartened, discouraged, and weakened in any duty because of
      men's dispraises, its a sign thou lovest thyself too much.
    </p>

    <p>
      So for the will, if thou can be content to give way even from that
      which thou hast said shall be, yea, vowed shall be, when better
      reason cometh, and hast that reverence of other men, as that
      when it standeth but upon a matter of will, thou art as willing
      their wills should stand as thine, and art not sad, churlish, or
      discontented, (<cite>1 Kings 21. 4.</cite>) but cheerful in thine heart,
      though thy will be crossed, it is a good sign, but if not, thou
      art sick of a self-will, and must purge it out. I the rather press
      these things, because I see many men both wise and religious, which
      yet are so tainted with this pestilent self-love, as that it is in
      them even as a dead fly to the apothecaries' ointment, spoiling
      the efficacy of all their graces, making their lives uncomfortable
      to themselves, and unprofitable to others, being neither fit for
      church nor commonwealth, but have even their very souls in hazard
      thereby, and therefore who can say too much against it.
    </p>

    <p>
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
      It is reported, that there are many men gone to that other
      plantation in <i>Virginia</i>, which, whilst they lived in <i>England</i>,
      seemed very religious, zealous, and conscionable; and have now lost
      even the sap of grace, and edge to all goodness; and are become
      mere worldlings. This testimony I believe to be partly true, and
      amongst many causes of it, this self-love is not the least. It is
      indeed a matter of some commendation for a man to remove himself
      out of a thronged place into a wide wilderness; to take in hand
      so long and dangerous a journey, to be an instrument to carry the
      Gospel and humanity among the brutish heathen; but there may be
      many goodly shews and glosses and yet a pad in the straw, men may
      make a great appearance of respect unto God, and yet but dissemble
      with him, having their own lusts carrying them: and, out of doubt,
      men that have taken in hand hither to come, out of discontentment
      in regard of their estates in <i>England</i>; and aiming at great
      matters here, affecting it to be gentlemen, landed men, or hoping
      for office, place, dignity, or fleshly liberty; let the shew be
      what it will, the substance is naught, and that bird of self-love
      which was hatched at home, if it be not looked to, will eat out
      the life of all grace and goodness: and though men have escaped
      the danger of the sea, and that cruel mortality, which swept away
      so many of our loving friends and brethren; yet except they purge
      out this self-love, a worse mischief is prepared for them: And who
      knoweth whether God in mercy have delivered those just men which
      here departed, from the evils to come; and from unreasonable men,
      in whom there neither was, nor is, any comfort, but grief, sorrow,
      affliction, and misery, till they cast out this spawn of self-love.
    </p>

    <p>
      But I have dwelt too long upon this first part; I come now to the
      second, which concerns an Exhortation, as I shewed you, in the
      Division.
    </p>

    <p>
      <em>But every man another's wealth.</em>
    </p>

    <p>
      In direct opposition, he should say, <em>Let every man seek
      another's</em>, but the first part being compared with the latter, and
      (<em>seek</em>) being taken out of the former and put to the latter, and
      (<em>wealth</em>) taken out or rather implied, in the former, the whole
      sentence is thus resolved, <em>Let no man seek his own wealth, but let
      every man seek another's wealth</em>.
    </p>

    <p>
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
      And the word here translated <em>wealth</em>, is the same with that in
      <cite>Rom. 13. 4,</cite> and may not be taken only for riches, as Englishmen
      commonly understand it, but for all kinds of benefits, favors,
      comforts either for soul or body; and so here again, as before you
      must understand an Affirmative Commandment, as the Negative was
      before: and least any should say, If I may not seek my own good, I
      may do nothing; Yes saith <i>Paul</i>, I'll tell thee, thou shalt seek
      the good of another, whereas now all thy seeking helps but one, by
      this means thou shalt help many: and this is further enforced by
      these two circumstances, (no man) may seek his own, be he rich,
      learned, wise, &amp;c. <em>But every man must seek the good of another</em>.
    </p>

    <p>
      The point of instruction is taken from the very letter and phrase,
      viz.
    </p>

    <p>
      Doct. 2. <em>A man</em> must <em>seek the good, the wealth, the profit of
      others.</em>
    </p>

    <p>
      I say he <em>must</em> seek it, he must seek the comfort, profit and
      benefit of his neighbor, brother, associate, &amp;c. His own good he
      need not seek, it will offer itself to him every hour; but the good
      of others must be sought, a man must not stay from doing good to
      others till he is sought unto, pulled and hauled, (as it were) like
      the unjust judge, for every benefit that is first craved, cometh
      too late. And thus the ancient patriarchs did practice, when the
      traveller and wayfaring men came by, they did not tarry till they
      came and asked relief and refreshment, but sat at the gates to
      watch for such, (<cite>Judges 19. 20, 21</cite>) and looked in the streets to
      find them, yea, set open their doors that they might freely and
      boldly enter in. And howsoever, some may think this too large a
      practice, since now the world is so full of people, yet I see not
      but the more people there is, the larger charity ought to be.
    </p>

    <p>
      But be it so, as a man may neglect, in some sort the general
      world, yet those to whom he is bound, either in natural, civil,
      or religious bands, them he must seek how to do them good. A
      notable example you have in <i>David</i>, who, because there was twixt
      him and <i>Jonathan</i> a band and covenant, therefore he enquired,
      <em>Whether there was any left of the house of Saul, to whom he might
      shew mercy for Jonathan's sake</em>, 2 Sam. 9.1. So this people of
      <i>Corinth</i>,
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
                      to whom <i>Paul</i> writeth, they were in a spiritual league
      and covenant in the <i>Gospel</i>, and so were a body. Now for one
      member in the body to seek himself, and neglect all others were, as
      if a man should clothe one arm or one leg of his body with gold and
      purple, and let all the rest of the members go naked. <cite>1 Cor. 12.
      27.</cite>
    </p>

    <p>
      Now brethren, I pray you, remember yourselves, and know, that you
      are not in a retired monastical course, but have given your names
      and promises one to another and covenanted here to cleave together
      in the service of God, and the King; What then must you do? May
      you live as retired hermits? and look after no body? Nay, you must
      seek still the wealth of one another; and enquire as <i>David</i>, how
      liveth such a man? How is he clad? How is he fed? He is my brother,
      my associate; we ventured our lives together here, and had a hard
      brunt of it and we are in league together. Is his labor harder than
      mine? surely I will ease him; hath he no bed to lie on? why, I have
      two, I'll lend him one; hath he no apparel? why, I have two suits,
      I'll give him one of them; eats he coarse fare, bread and water,
      and I have better, why, surely we will part stakes. He is as good a
      man as I, and we are bound each to other, so that his wants must be
      my wants, his sorrows my sorrows, his sickness my sickness, and his
      welfare my welfare, for I am as he is. And such a sweet sympathy
      were excellent, comfortable, yea, heavenly, and is the only maker
      and conserver of churches and commonwealths, and where this is
      wanting, ruin comes on quickly, as it did here in <i>Corinth</i>.
    </p>

    <p>
      But besides these motives, there are other reasons to provoke us
      not only to do good one to another; but even to seek and search how
      to do it.
    </p>

    <p>
      1. As first, to maintain modesty in all our associates, that of
      hungry wanters, they become not bold beggars and impudent cravers;
      for as one saith of women, that, when they have lost their
      shamefacedness, they have lost half their honesty, so may it be
      truly said of a man that when he hath lost his modesty, and puts
      on a begging face, he hath lost his majesty, and the image of that
      noble creature; and man should not beg and crave of man, but only
      of God. True it is, that as Christ was fain to crave
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
                                                           water of the
      Samaritan woman, (<cite>John 4. 5.</cite>) so men are forced to ask sometimes
      rather than starve, but indeed in all societies it should be
      offered them. Men often complain of men's boldness in asking, but
      how cometh this to pass, but because the world have been so full
      of self-lovers as no man would offer their money, meat, garments,
      though they saw men hungry, harborless, poor, and naked in the
      streets; and what is it that makes men brazen-faced, bold, brutish,
      tumultuous, but because they are pinched with want, and see others
      of their companions (which it may be have less deserved) to live in
      prosperity and pleasure?
    </p>

    <p>
      2. It wonderfully encourageth men in their duties, when they see
      the burthen equally borne; but when some withdraw themselves and
      retire to their own particular ease, pleasure, or profit; what
      heart can men have to go on in their business? when men are come
      together to lift some weighty piece of timber or vessel; if one
      stand still and do not lift, shall not the rest be weakened and
      disheartened? Will not a few idle drones spoil the whole stock of
      laborious bees: so one idle-belly, one murmurer, one complainer,
      one self-lover will weaken and dishearten a whole colony. Great
      matters have been brought to pass where men have cheerfully as
      with one heart, hand, and shoulder, gone about it, both in wars,
      buildings, and plantations, but where every man seeks himself, all
      cometh to nothing.
    </p>

    <p>
      3. The present necessity requireth it, as it did in the days of the
      <i>Jews</i>, returning from captivity, and as it was here in <i>Corinth</i>.
      The country is yet raw, the land untilled, the cities not builded,
      the cattle not settled, we are compassed about with a helpless and
      idle people, the natives of the country, which cannot in any comely
      or comfortable manner help themselves, much less us. We also have
      been very chargeable to many of our loving friends, which helped
      us hither, and now again supplied us, so that before we think of
      gathering riches, we must even in conscience think of requiting
      their charge, love and labor, and cursed be that profit and gain
      which aimeth not at this. Besides, how many of our dear friends did
      here die at our first entrance, many of them no doubt
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
                                                            for want of
      good lodging, shelter, and comfortable things, and many more may go
      after them quickly, if care be not taken. Is this then a time for
      men to begin to seek themselves? <i>Paul</i> saith, that men in the last
      days shall be lovers of themselves, (<cite>2 Tim. 3. 2.</cite>) but it is here
      yet but the first days, and (as it were) the dawning of this new
      world, it is now therefore no time for men to look to get riches,
      brave clothes, dainty fare, but to look to present necessities; it
      is now no time to pamper the flesh, live at ease, snatch, catch,
      scrape, and pill, and hoard up, but rather to open the doors, the
      chests, and vessels, and say, brother, neighbor, friend, what
      want ye, any thing that I have? make bold with it, it is yours to
      command, to do you good, to comfort and cherish you, and glad I am
      that I have it for you.
    </p>

    <p>
      4. And even the example of God himself, whom we should follow
      in all things within our power and capacity, may teach us this
      lesson, for (with reverence to his Majesty be it spoken) he might
      have kept all grace, goodness, and glory to himself, but he hath
      communicated it to us, even as far as we are capable of it in this
      life, and will communicate his glory in all fulness with his elect
      in that life to come; even so his son Jesus Christ left his glory
      eclipsed for a time, and abased himself to a poor and distressed
      life in this world, that he might, by it, bring us to happiness in
      the world to come. If God then have delighted in thus doing good
      and relieving frail and miserable man, so far inferior to himself,
      what delight ought man to have to relieve and comfort man, which is
      equal to himself?
    </p>

    <p>
      5. Even as we deal with others, ourselves and others shall be
      dealt withal. Carest thou not how others fare, how they toil,
      are grieved, sick, pinched, cold, harborless, so as thou be in
      health, livest at ease, warm in thy nest, farest well? The days
      will come when thou shalt labor and none shall pity thee, be poor
      and none relieve thee, be sick, and lie and die and none visit
      thee, yea, and thy children shall lie and starve in the streets,
      and none shall relieve them, for <em>it is the merciful that shall
      obtain mercy</em>; Mat. 5. 7. and <em>the memory of the just shall be
      blessed</em> even in his seed; <cite>Prov. 10.</cite> and a merciful and loving
      man
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
          when he dies, though he leave his children small and desolate,
      yet every one is mercifully stirred up for the father's sake to
      shew compassion, but the unkindness, currishness, and self-love
      of a father, is through God's just judgment recompensed upon the
      children with neglect and cruelty.
    </p>

    <p>
      6. Lastly, That we may draw to an end; A merciless man, and a man
      without natural affection or love, is reckoned among such as are
      given over of God to a reprobate mind, (<cite>Rom. 1. 30.</cite>) and (as it
      were) transformed into a beast-like humor; for, what is man if he
      be not sociable, kind, affable, free-hearted, liberal; he is a
      beast in the shape of a man; or rather an infernal spirit, walking
      amongst men, which makes the world a hell what in him lieth; for,
      it is even a hell to live where there are such men: such the
      Scriptures calleth <i>Nabals</i>, which signifieth <i>fools</i>, (<cite>Psal.
      14. 1.</cite>) and decayed men, which have lost both the sap of grace
      and nature; and such merciless men are called goats, and shall be
      set at Christ's left hand at the last day, (<cite>Math. 25. 33.</cite>) <em>Oh
      therefore seek the wealth one of another</em>.
    </p>

    <p>
      <i>Obj.</i> But some will say, <em>It is true, and it were well if men
      would so do, but we see every man is so for himself, as that if I
      should not do so, I should do full ill, for if I have it not of
      my own, I may snap short sometimes, for I see no body showeth me
      any kindness, nor giveth me any thing; if I have gold or silver,
      that goeth for payment, and if I want it I may lie in the street,
      therefore I had best keep that I have, and not be so liberal as you
      would have me, except I saw others would be so towards me</em>.
    </p>

    <p>
      <i>Ans.</i> This Objection seemeth but equal and reasonable, as did the
      Answer of <i>Nabal</i> to <i>David's</i> men, but it is most foolish and
      carnal, as his also was; for, if we should measure our courses by
      most men's practices, a man should never do any godly duty; for,
      do not the most, yea, almost all, go the broad way that leadeth to
      death and damnation, (<cite>Luke. 13. 23, 24.</cite>) Who then will follow a
      multitude? It is the word of God, and the examples of the best men
      that we must follow. And what if others will do nothing for thee,
      but are unkind and unmerciful to thee? Knowest thou not that they
      which will be the
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
                        children of God must be kind to the unkind,
      loving to their enemies, and bless those that curse them? (<cite>Mat.
      5. 44, 47.</cite>) If all men were kind to thee, it were but <i>publicans'</i>
      righteousness to be kind to them? If all men be evil, wilt thou be
      so too? When <i>David</i> cried out, <em>Help Lord, for not a godly man is
      left</em>, Psal. 12. 1. did he himself turn ungodly also? Nay, he was
      rather the more strict. So, if love and charity be departed out of
      this world, be thou one of them that shall first bring it in again.
    </p>

    <p>
      And let this be the first rule, which I will with two others
      conclude for this time.
    </p>

    <p>
      1. Never measure thy course by the most, but by the best, yea,
      and principally by God's word; Look not what others do to thee,
      but consider what thou art to do to them: seek to please God, not
      thyself. Did they in <cite>Mat. 25. 44</cite>. plead, that others did nothing
      for them? No such matter, no such plea will stand before God, his
      word is plain to the contrary, therefore, though all the world
      should neglect thee, disregard thee, and contemn thee, yet remember
      thou hast not to do with men, but with the highest God, and so thou
      must do thy duty to them notwithstanding.
    </p>

    <p>
      2. And let there be no prodigal person to come forth and say, Give
      me the portion of lands and goods that appertaineth to me, and let
      me shift for myself; <cite>Luke 15. 12.</cite> It is yet too soon to put men
      to their shifts; <i>Israel</i> was seven years in <i>Canaan</i>, before the
      land was divided unto tribes, much longer before it was divided
      unto families; and why wouldst thou have thy particular portion,
      but because thou thinkest to live better than thy neighbor, and
      scornest to live so meanly as he? but who, I pray thee, brought
      this particularizing first into the world? Did not Satan, who was
      not content to keep that equal state with his fellows, but would
      set his throne above the stars? Did not he also entice man to
      despise his general felicity and happiness, and go try particular
      knowledge of good and evil; and nothing in this world doth more
      resemble heavenly happiness, than for men to live as one, being of
      one heart, and one soul; neither any thing more resembles hellish
      horror, then for every man to shift for himself; for if it be a
      good mind and practise, thus to affect
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
                                             particulars, <em>mine</em> and
      <em>thine</em>, then it should be best also for God to provide one heaven
      for thee, and another for thy neighbor.
    </p>

    <p>
      <i>Object.</i> But some will say, <em>If all men will do their endeavors as
      I do I could be content with this generality,&mdash;but many are idle
      and slothful, and eat up others' labors, and therefore it is best
      to part, and then every man may do his pleasure</em>.
    </p>

    <p>
      First, this, indeed, is the common plea of such as will endure no
      inconveniences, and so for the hardness of men's hearts, God and
      man doth often give way to that which is not best, nor perpetual,
      but indeed if we take this course to change ordinances and
      practices because of inconveniences, we shall have every day new
      laws.
    </p>

    <p>
      Secondly, if others be idle and thou diligent, thy fellowship,
      provocation, and example, may well help to cure that malady in
      them, being together, but being asunder, shall they not be more
      idle, and shall not gentry and beggary be quickly the glorious
      ensigns of your commonwealth?
    </p>

    <p>
      Thirdly, construe things in the best part, be not too hasty to
      say, men are idle and slothful, all men have not strength, skill,
      faculty, spirit, and courage to work alike; it is thy glory and
      credit, that thou canst do so well, and his shame and reproach,
      that can do no better; and are not these sufficient rewards to you
      both.
    </p>

    <p>
      Fourthly, if any be idle apparently, you have a law and governors
      to execute the same, and to follow that rule of the Apostle, to
      keep back their bread, and let them not eat, go not therefore
      whispering, to charge men with idleness; but go to the governor and
      prove them idle; and thou shall see them have their deserts. <cite>Acts
      19. 38. 2</cite> <cite>Thes. 3. 10.</cite> <cite>Deut. 19. 15.</cite>
    </p>

    <p>
      And as you are a body together, so hang not together by skins and
      gymocks, but labor to be jointed together and knit by flesh and
      sinews; away with envy at the good of others, and rejoice in his
      good, and sorrow for his evil. Let his joy be thy joy, and his
      sorrow thy sorrow: Let his sickness be thy sickness: his hunger thy
      hunger: his poverty thy poverty; and if you profess friendship, be
      friends in adversity; for then a friend is known and tried, and not
      before.
    </p>

    <p>
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
      3. Lay away all thought of former things and forget them, and
      think upon the things that are; look not gapingly one upon other,
      pleading your goodness, your birth, your life you lived, your
      means you had and might have had; here you are by God's providence
      under difficulties; be thankful to God, it is no worse, and take
      it in good part that which is, and lift not up yourself because of
      former privileges; when <i>Job</i> was brought to the dung-hill, he sat
      down upon it, <cite>Job 2. 8.</cite> and when the Almighty had been bitter
      to <i>Naomi</i>, she would be called <i>Marah</i>; consider therefore what
      you are now, and whose you are; say not I could have lived thus,
      and thus; but say thus and thus I must live: for God and natural
      necessity requireth, if your difficulties be great, you had need to
      cleave the faster together, and comfort and cheer up one another,
      laboring to make each other's burden lighter; there is no grief
      so tedious as a churlish companion and nothing makes sorrows easy
      more than cheerful associates: bear ye therefore one another's
      burthen, and be not a burthen one to another; avoid all factions,
      frowardness, singularity and withdrawings, and cleave fast to the
      Lord, and one to another continually; so shall you be a notable
      precedent to these poor heathens, whose eyes are upon you, and who
      very brutishly and cruelly do daily eat and consume one another,
      through their emulations, ways and contentions; be you therefore
      ashamed of it, and win them to peace both with yourselves, and one
      another, by your peaceable examples, which will preach louder to
      them, than if you could cry in their barbarous language; so also
      shall you be an encouragement to many of your christian friends in
      your native country, to come to you, when they hear of your peace,
      love and kindness that is amongst you: but above all, it shall go
      well with your souls, when that God of peace and unity shall come
      to visit you with death as he hath done many of your associates,
      you being found of him, not in murmurings, discontent and jars, but
      in brotherly love, and peace, may be translated from this wandering
      wilderness unto that joyful and heavenly Canaan.
    </p>

      AMEN.
